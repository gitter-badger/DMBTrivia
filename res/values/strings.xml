    <string name="InfoText">DMB Trivia Mini-FAQ:\n\nQ: Why does my score go down?\nA: When anyone gets a question correct, the score for that question decreases.  Everyone\'s score is recalculated periodically to use the new question scores.\n\nQ: How are the question values calculated?\nA: A question\'s value is calculated based on the number of times it has been correctly answered/skipped.  The maxiumum point value for a quesiton is 1000 (hardest) and the minimum is 100 (easiest).\n\nQ: Does using a hint penalize me?\nA: Using a hint cuts the value you can earn for answering that question correct in half.\n\nQ: Why are answers revealed?\nA: The goal was to make a trivia game that would attempt to inspire people to seek out new DMB audio, stories, etc.  By revealing the answer we feel the app is more than a test or a quiz.  Hopefully it inspires people to get more interested in the band and their music.\n\nQ: How many questions are there?\nA: Over 1500 - More can be added without an application update so overtime the number will grow and questions about current tours/DMB news should be incorportated.\n\nQ: What if I find an error in a question or a question that can\'t be answered?\nA: Please report that issue to us @dmbtrivia or via email jaybtv5@gmail.com or choose Report Question from the menu.\n\nQ: These questions are impossible - how do people know so much about DMB tours and dates?\nA: The Dave Matthews Band allows live audio recording of their concerts which are then shared by tapers.  DMB also provides realtime setlist information on their website during shows.  There\'s a large community of fans who download/collect live audio recordings and/or also follow and discuss show setlists.  If these questions prove difficult for most their score values will increase.  See below for a few good fan websites that may help you follow upcoming DMB tours and or revist old shows and setlists.\n\nQ: Who developed this game?\nA: @jeffthefate (Coder) &amp; @Copperpot5 (Audio/Question set).\n\nQ: My friend/etc has an iPhone - is there an iPhone version coming soon?\nA: We have no plans to develop an iphone version of "DMBTrivia" at this time for a variety of reasons.\n\nOfficial DMB site for realtime setlist, merch, etc: www.dmband.com\nDMB Setlists, Songs Statistics, Guest Information, etc: www.dmbalmanac.com\nFree live/legal downloads of DMB audio recordings: www.dreamingtree.org\nGeneral forum discussion: www.antsmarching.org\nMP3 rarity and tour highlights: www.dontburnthepig.org\n\nMany rarities and highlights can also be found on YouTube.\n\nFeel free to ask general DMB questions to @dmbtrivia as well.  We\'re friendly and always looking to help fans find the DMB info/fan media they\'re looking for.</string>
